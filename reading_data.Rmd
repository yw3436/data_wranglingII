## Script a table

First, we want the first table from the web. 
read in the HTML
```{r}
url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm" # save the url to the variable called url
drug_use_html = read_html(url)

drug_use_html
```

extract the table(s); focus on the first one
```{r}
tabl_marj = 
  drug_use_html %>% 
  html_nodes(css = "table") %>% ## transfer the original data into table; 15 tables in total
  first() %>%  # take the first one; also there is end() or other similar functions
  html_table() %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```
